# Boolean Smoothie Shop - Game Canvas

## PLATFORM
Web-based browser game with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for maximum accessibility across devices. Cross-platform compatibility ensures students can play on laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Responsive design optimized for touch controls on mobile devices while supporting mouse/keyboard on desktop.

## GAMEPLAY
Players operate a smoothie shop where each customer presents logical premises as ingredients and requests a smoothie representing a specific conclusion. Players must apply inference rules (represented as blending operations) to transform the given ingredients into the required result. Success depends on selecting the correct logical operations and completing orders before customer patience runs out. Three hearts system creates meaningful consequences for failed orders.

## LEVELS
Endless progression system with automatically scaling difficulty instead of fixed levels. Early customers require simple single-step operations (modus ponens, simplification), while later customers demand complex multi-step reasoning chains. Customer patience decreases and order complexity increases as the game progresses. New inference rules unlock based on player proficiency rather than level completion.

## AUDIENCE
Primary target: Students (16-24) studying logic, discrete mathematics, and computer science. Secondary audience includes logic puzzle enthusiasts, educators teaching reasoning skills, and mobile gamers seeking brain training. Designed for both classroom practice and independent study sessions with varying difficulty accommodations.

## STORY
Player manages "The Logic Smoothie Shop," where customers arrive with ingredient combinations representing logical premises. Each customer expects a perfectly reasoned smoothie that demonstrates valid logical conclusions. Success depends on mastering the art of logical blending - transforming abstract reasoning into delicious results. Normal customers with everyday names (Sarah, Mike, Emma) create a friendly, approachable atmosphere.

## HERO
The player embodies a smoothie shop owner learning to create drinks through logical reasoning rather than traditional recipes. Starting with basic inference skills, they develop mastery through serving increasingly demanding customers. Character growth mirrors real learning progression in logical thinking, from simple pattern recognition to complex multi-step reasoning.

## ENEMIES
Customer patience timers serve as the primary challenge, creating urgency as patience bars decrease over time. Logical dead-ends act as obstacles when players apply incorrect reasoning chains. Heart loss occurs when customers leave unsatisfied, creating meaningful stakes. Complex multi-step orders function as boss-level challenges requiring chained inference applications to satisfy demanding customers.

## SCORING
Base points for correct orders (100), with speed bonus tiers: fast completion (+50 points), very fast completion (+25 points). Consecutive successful orders build combo multipliers for sustained excellence. Hearts lost result in point penalties (-50 per heart). No negative scoring for incorrect attempts to encourage experimentation and learning through trial and feedback.

## EXTRAS
Inventory system resets for each customer, starting with their given premises and growing as inference rules generate new logical results. Menu includes infinite patience mode toggle for stress-free learning and practice. Debug game over button enables testing and development. Clean, colorful interface avoids intimidating mathematical notation, using smoothie shop metaphors to make abstract logical concepts accessible and engaging for all skill levels.
