# Logic Mixology: Inference Bar - Game Canvas

## PLATFORM
Web-based browser game with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for maximum accessibility across devices. Cross-platform compatibility ensures students can play on laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Future mobile app versions for iOS/Android to support offline studying.

## GAMEPLAY
Players drag emoji ingredients (üçãüçìü•ù) and logical operators (‚û°Ô∏èü•§üîÄ‚ùå) to create formulas that satisfy customer orders using inference rules. Customers present logical premises and conclusions, requiring players to mix the correct logical "drink" recipe. Time pressure and combo multipliers create engaging challenge while reinforcing discrete math concepts.

## LEVELS
Three progressive bartender skill levels: Junior Bartender (modus ponens, simplification), Skilled Mixologist (adds modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism), and Master Bartender (full inference rule set). Each level increases customer patience demands, introduces complex rule combinations, and unlocks achievement-based progression.

## AUDIENCE
Primary target: College students (18-24) studying discrete mathematics and formal logic courses. Secondary audience includes logic puzzle enthusiasts, educators teaching mathematical reasoning, and brain-training mobile gamers. Designed for both classroom integration and independent study sessions.

## STORY
Player manages "The Inference Bar," a mystical tavern where drinks are crafted through logical reasoning rather than traditional recipes. Customers are fellow scholars, professors, and logic enthusiasts seeking perfectly reasoned beverages. Progression unlocks new areas of the tavern and reveals the deeper mysteries of logical mixology.

## HERO
The player embodies an aspiring logical bartender learning the ancient art of inference-based drink crafting. Starting as a novice with basic reasoning skills, they develop mastery through practice and customer feedback. Character growth mirrors real learning progression in discrete mathematics courses.

## ENEMIES
Time pressure serves as the primary antagonist, with impatient customers whose patience bars decrease over time. Logical fallacies appear as "contaminated ingredients" that must be avoided. Complex multi-step proofs create challenging boss encounters requiring chained inference rules to satisfy demanding master customers.

## SCORING
Base points for correct answers (100), with multipliers for difficulty (1.0x-1.6x), speed bonuses (25-50 points), and combo chains (up to 3.0x multiplier). Achievement system rewards perfect streaks, rule mastery, and customer satisfaction. Negative points for timeouts (-10) and incorrect reasoning (-20) maintain challenge balance.

## EXTRAS
Symbol reference legend helps players learn emoji-to-logic mappings, keyboard shortcuts enable rapid ingredient selection, and solution hints provide guided learning support. Timer disable mode allows stress-free practice, while achievement unlocks and leaderboards motivate continued engagement and friendly competition among classmates.
