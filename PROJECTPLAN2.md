# **Project Proposal: Boolean Logic Learning Game**

## **Educational Mobile Software for Discrete Structures I**

---

## **Project Overview**

This innovative educational mobile game is designed to teach first-year Computer Science and Information Technology students the fundamental concepts of boolean logic and rules of inference through an engaging, gamified experience using carefully crafted analogies and themes.

## **Problem Statement**

Students studying logical proofs and rules of inference face significant learning challenges that impede their academic success, particularly in Discrete Mathematics courses:

### **Pain Point 1: Traditional Teaching Method Limitations**

Students struggle with understanding logical proofs and inference rules due to traditional teaching methods that rely heavily on lectures and static exercises. This approach results in low engagement, limited practice opportunities, and difficulty grasping complex logical concepts that require intensive critical thinking and detailed solution tracing.

### **Pain Point 2: Lack of Accessible Learning Resources**

The absence of convenient and accessible learning methods presents a significant challenge for students. Current resources fail to provide the interactive, hands-on practice necessary for students to internalize logical reasoning concepts without proper guidance, making it difficult for learners to find effective educational support.

### **Pain Point 3: Existing Solution Inadequacies**

Available learning solutions—including textbooks, video tutorials, and online courses—fall short of addressing student needs. While they provide theoretical knowledge, they lack the dynamic, interactive features necessary for effective practice and reinforcement. Students are left to manually formulate, write, and verify solutions through time-consuming processes prone to errors.

### **Pain Point 4: Individual Learning Adaptation Gaps**

Traditional educational resources fail to adapt to individual learning paces and styles, making it difficult for students to identify and address their specific weaknesses. The absence of instant feedback mechanisms and personalized learning pathways limits students' ability to build confidence in applying logical reasoning concepts.

## **Main Objectives (SMART Goals)**

### **1\. Learning Effectiveness Goal (Addresses Pain Point 1: Traditional Teaching Method Limitations)**

Demonstrate measurable improvement in student comprehension and retention of logical proofs and inference rules within one academic year by developing a mobile educational game using Godot engine that transforms static, lecture-based instruction into interactive, gamified learning experiences, validated through comparative pre/post assessment studies that track logical reasoning skill development in Discrete Mathematics students.

### **2\. Student Engagement Goal (Addresses Pain Point 2: Lack of Accessible Learning Resources)**

### **3\. Interactive Learning Goal (Addresses Pain Point 3: Existing Solution Inadequacies)**

Overcome limitations of traditional textbooks, videos, and online courses by delivering dynamic, interactive learning features within six months of project initiation through AI-powered validation systems, instant feedback mechanisms, and gamified practice environments that eliminate time-consuming manual solution verification and reduce error-prone processes.

### **4\. Personalized Learning Goal (Addresses Pain Point 4: Individual Learning Adaptation Gaps)**

Achieve personalized learning adaptation that addresses individual student weaknesses and learning paces within the eight-month project delivery timeline through adaptive difficulty systems, personalized feedback pathways, and comprehensive progress tracking that enables students to identify and address their specific logical reasoning challenges effectively.
