## Product Design

### Player Experience and Game POV
The player embodies a smoothie shop owner who creates drinks using logical reasoning rather than traditional recipes. Each customer presents logical premises as ingredients and expects a smoothie that represents the valid conclusion through proper application of inference rules.

Players experience growing mastery as they learn to quickly identify which logical operations to apply to customer ingredients. The emotional journey moves from initial confusion to confident pattern recognition, culminating in the satisfaction of serving complex logical smoothies under time pressure while maintaining their heart-based lives.

### Visual and Audio Style
**Visual Design:**
- Bright, colorful smoothie shop aesthetic with clean, friendly interface
- Ingredient bottles represent logical premises with colorful, approachable icons
- Operation tools (blender, mixer, shaker) represent different inference rules
- Customer patience visualized through animated timer bars
- Hearts display as cute, glowing life indicators
- Smooth animations for ingredient combining and smoothie creation

**Audio Design:**
- Upbeat, cheerful background music reminiscent of a busy cafe
- Satisfying blending sounds for correct logical operations
- Gentle warning chimes for low patience or incorrect attempts
- Customer satisfaction sounds that reinforce positive feedback
- Heart loss sound that creates appropriate urgency without being harsh

### Game World Fiction
Players operate "The Logic Smoothie Shop," where customers arrive with specific logical ingredient combinations and expect smoothies that represent valid conclusions. Each customer has their own patience level and preferences, creating a bustling environment where logical reasoning skills determine business success.

The shop exists in a world where logical thinking is the key to customer satisfaction - where applying the right inference rule creates the perfect smoothie blend, and logical errors result in disappointed customers and lost hearts.

## Detailed Game Systems Design

### Core Gameplay Loop
**Primary Loop (30-90 seconds per customer):**
1. Customer arrives with logical premises (ingredients) and desired conclusion
2. Player examines available ingredients in their current inventory
3. Player selects appropriate inference rule/operation to apply
4. Player applies rule to ingredients to generate new logical results
5. Player continues applying rules until reaching the required conclusion
6. Customer evaluates the logical validity and provides feedback
7. Player receives score based on correctness and speed

**Secondary Loop (continuous):**
- Maintain hearts by satisfying customers before patience runs out
- Build score through successful orders and speed bonuses
- Experience gradually increasing difficulty as game progresses
- Unlock new inference rules and operations over time

**Meta Loop (session-based):**
- Compete for high scores in endless progression
- Track personal best scores and improvement over time
- Master all available inference rules through repeated practice

### Heart and Life System
- Players start each game with 3 hearts
- Hearts are lost when customers leave due to:
  - Patience timer running out
  - Providing incorrect logical conclusion
- Game ends when all hearts are lost
- Hearts create tension and meaningful consequences for mistakes
- No heart regeneration during gameplay maintains challenge

### Customer and Order System
**Customer Behavior:**
- One customer served at a time to maintain focus
- Each customer presents 2-5 logical premises and one required conclusion
- Customers have individual patience timers that create urgency
- Normal, friendly names (Sarah, Mike, Emily, etc.) rather than logic-themed names
- Patience levels vary by customer, creating different challenge types

**Order Complexity:**
- Early customers require simple single-step inferences
- Later customers demand multi-step logical reasoning
- Difficulty scales naturally based on game progression
- Orders always have valid logical solutions using available rules

### Inventory and Ingredient System
**Inventory Mechanics:**
- Inventory resets completely for each new customer order
- Always starts with the customer's given premises
- New logical statements added when inference rules are successfully applied
- Previous results remain available for further operations within the same order
- Inference rules themselves never run out and are always accessible

**Ingredient Processing:**
- Players cannot create logical statements directly
- All new logical results must come from applying rules to existing inventory
- Multiple paths may exist to reach the same conclusion
- Players encouraged to find efficient solution paths for speed bonuses

### Scoring and Progression
**Scoring System:**
- Base score for correct completion: 100 points
- Speed bonus tiers:
  - Fast completion: +50 points
  - Very fast completion: +25 points
  - Standard completion: Base score only
- Consecutive successful orders create combo multipliers
- Points deducted for hearts lost (-50 per heart)

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Game automatically scales difficulty based on performance
- New inference rules unlock as players demonstrate proficiency
- Customer patience decreases gradually over time
- Order complexity increases with more premises and longer solution paths

### Available Inference Rules and Operations
**Basic Rules (unlocked first):**
- Modus Ponens
- Simplification
- Addition

**Intermediate Rules:**
- Modus Tollens
- Disjunctive Syllogism
- Hypothetical Syllogism

**Advanced Rules:**
- De Morgan's Laws
- Distribution
- Absorption
- Complex multi-step proof techniques

### User Interface and Controls
**Main Game Interface:**
- Customer area showing current order and patience timer
- Inventory panel displaying available logical statements
- Operation selection area with available inference rules
- Score and hearts display prominently visible
- Clean, touch-friendly design for mobile play

**Menu System:**
- Play button to start new game
- Settings option including:
  - Infinite patience mode toggle (for learning/practice)
  - Sound/music controls
- Debug game over button for testing purposes
- High score tracking and display

### Platform and Technology
**Platform:** Web-based (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript) for maximum accessibility
**Target Devices:** Smartphones, tablets, laptops
**Technology:** Responsive design supporting touch and mouse input
**Performance:** Optimized for smooth gameplay on mid-range mobile devices

### Educational Integration
**Learning Approach:**
- Implicit learning through gameplay rather than explicit instruction
- Pattern recognition development through repeated rule application
- Natural progression from simple to complex logical reasoning
- Immediate feedback reinforces correct logical thinking

**Avoiding Mathematical Intimidation:**
- No formal logical notation displayed during gameplay
- Smoothie shop metaphors make abstract concepts concrete
- Focus on pattern recognition rather than formal proof writing
- Success measured through gameplay achievement rather than test scores

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Major Risks:**
- Balancing educational value with engaging gameplay
- Ensuring logical accuracy while maintaining accessibility
- Player retention in endless gameplay format
- Difficulty scaling that challenges without frustrating

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Extensive playtesting with target student audience
- Consultation with logic education experts during development
- Multiple difficulty options to accommodate different skill levels
- Clear visual feedback and helpful hints to reduce frustration
