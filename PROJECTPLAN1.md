## **SMART Goals**

### **1\. Learning Effectiveness Goal**

Develop a mobile educational game using Godot engine that demonstrates a 60% improvement in student post-assessment scores on boolean logic and inference rules compared to traditional teaching methods, leveraging research-proven gamification principles that enhance STEM learning outcomes by 40-75% and validating effectiveness through comparative studies within one academic year to directly address core Discrete Structures I curriculum objectives.

### **2\. Student Engagement Goal**

Create an engaging mobile gaming experience that maintains 80% active participation rate among enrolled students during semester usage by leveraging proven gamification principles, intuitive touch-based interactions, and meaningful progression systems that address documented low engagement rates in traditional discrete mathematics instruction and achieve target metrics within the first four months of deployment.

### **3\. Technical Performance Goal**

Deliver a high-performance mobile application using Godot engine that achieves sub-2 second load times and maintains consistent 60fps gameplay on target smartphones and tablets through optimized asset management, efficient memory usage, and platform-specific performance tuning essential for maintaining student engagement in diverse mobile educational environments, with all benchmarks validated during beta testing within six months of project initiation.

### **4\. Content Coverage Goal**

Implement comprehensive boolean logic curriculum coverage that includes all 12 core inference rules (Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Simplification, Addition, Disjunctive Syllogism, Hypothetical Syllogism, De Morgan's Laws, Distribution, Absorption, plus 3 advanced multi-step techniques) through progressive gameplay mechanics following established educational scaffolding principles to ensure complete alignment with Discrete Structures I learning objectives and academic standards within the eight-month project delivery timeline.

## **Educational Philosophy**

This project embraces implicit learning through gameplay rather than explicit instruction, allowing students to develop pattern recognition and logical reasoning skills naturally through repeated practice in engaging mobile contexts. By avoiding intimidating mathematical notation and formal proofs during gameplay, the system makes discrete mathematics concepts accessible to students who might otherwise struggle with abstract logical thinking.

Carefully crafted thematic metaphors and analogies transform complex boolean operations into tangible, visual interactions that students can understand intuitively, building confidence before transitioning to formal mathematical representations. This approach aligns with constructivist learning theory, enabling students to build logical reasoning skills through hands-on mobile experience and immediate feedback.
