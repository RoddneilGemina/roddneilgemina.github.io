1. # **Introduction**

   1. ## ***Purpose*** 

* *Describe the purpose of the SRS;* 

* *Specify the intended audience for the SRS.* 

  2. ## ***Scope***

* *Identify the software product(s) to be produced by name (e.g., Host DBMS, Report Generator, etc.);* 

* *Explain what the software product(s) will, and, if necessary, will not do;* 

* *Describe the application of the software being specified, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals;* 

* * Be consistent with similar statements in higher-level specifications (e.g., the system requirements specification), if they exist.* 

  3. ## ***Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations***

* *provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS* 

  4. ## ***References***

* *Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS;*   
* *Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization;*   
* *Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.* 

2. # **Overall Description**

   1. ## ***Product perspective***

* *Put software product into perspective with other related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software.*   
* *A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external inter- faces can be helpful.*   
* *Describe the modular decomposition of the components using the format below:*  
  *Module 1*  
  *Transaction 1.1*  
  *Transaction 1.2*  
  *Module 2*  
  *Transaction 2.1*  
  *Transaction 2.2*  
  *. . .*

  2. ## ***User characteristics***

* *Describe all user types and their roles and privileges in the system*

## ***2.4. 	Constraints***

* *Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer’s options.*   
* *Regulatory policies;*   
* *Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);*   
* *Interfaces to other applications;*   
* *Parallel operation;*   
* *Audit functions;*   
* *Control functions;*   
* *Reliability requirements;*   
* *Criticality of the application;*   
* *Safety and security considerations.* 


## ***2.5. 	Assumptions and dependencies***

*This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not avail- able, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.* 

3. # **Specific Requirements** 

   1. ## ***External interface requirements***

### ***3.1.1.	Hardware interfaces*** {#3.1.1.-hardware-interfaces}

*This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hard- ware components of the system. This includes configuration characteristics (number of ports, instruction sets, etc.). It also covers such matters as what devices are to be supported, how they are to be supported, and protocols. For example, terminal support may specify full-screen support as opposed to line-by-line support.* 

### ***3.1.2.	Software interfaces***

*This should specify the use of other required software products (e.g., a data management system, an operating system, or a mathematical package), and interfaces with other application systems (e.g., the linkage between an accounts receivable system and a general ledger system).* 

### ***3.1.3.	Communications interfaces***

*This should specify the various interfaces to communications such as local network protocols, etc.*
