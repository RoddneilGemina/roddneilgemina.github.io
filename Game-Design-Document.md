3. **Rule Selection**: Player selects appropriate inference rule/operation from available tools
4. **Rule Application**: Player applies selected rule to combine premises, generating new logical results
5. **Iterative Process**: Player continues applying rules until reaching the required conclusion
6. **Order Completion**: Customer evaluates logical validity and provides immediate feedback
7. **Scoring**: Player receives points based on correctness, speed, and efficiency

### Secondary Loop (Continuous)
- Maintain 3 hearts by satisfying customers before patience timers expire
- Build cumulative score through successful orders and speed bonuses
- Experience gradually increasing difficulty and complexity

## Game Systems

### Heart and Life System
- **Starting Hearts**: 3 hearts per game session
- **Heart Loss Conditions**:
  - Customer patience timer expires
  - Providing incorrect logical conclusion
- **Game Over**: All hearts lost ends the session
- **No Regeneration**: Hearts cannot be recovered during gameplay
- **Purpose**: Creates meaningful consequences and engaging tension

### Customer and Order System

#### Customer Characteristics
- **Processing**: One customer served at a time for focused gameplay
- **Order Complexity**: 2-5 logical premises with one required conclusion
- **Patience System**: Individual timers creating varied urgency levels
- **Names**: Normal, friendly names (Sarah, Mike, Emily) avoiding logic terminology
- **Behavior**: Patience levels vary by customer type and game progression

#### Order Progression
- **Early Game**: Simple single-step inferences (modus ponens, simplification)
- **Mid Game**: Multi-step reasoning requiring 2-3 rule applications
- **Late Game**: Complex logical chains demanding advanced reasoning
- **Validity**: All orders guarantee valid logical solutions using available rules

### Inventory and Ingredient System

#### Inventory Mechanics
- **Reset Policy**: Complete inventory reset for each new customer
- **Starting State**: Always begins with customer's given premises
- **Growth System**: New logical statements added when rules are successfully applied
- **Persistence**: Previous results remain available within the same order
- **Rule Availability**: Inference rules never deplete and remain always accessible

#### Processing Rules
- **No Direct Creation**: Players cannot generate logical statements independently
- **Rule-Based Generation**: All new results must derive from applying rules to existing inventory
- **Multiple Paths**: Various solution routes may exist for the same conclusion
- **Efficiency Incentive**: Speed bonuses encourage finding optimal solution paths

### Scoring and Progression

#### Scoring System
- **Base Score**: 100 points for correct order completion
- **Speed Bonuses**:
  - Very Fast: +50 points
  - Fast: +25 points
  - Standard: Base score only
- **Combo System**: Consecutive successful orders create score multipliers
- **Penalties**: -50 points per heart lost
- **No Negative Scoring**: Incorrect attempts don't reduce points (encourages experimentation)

#### Difficulty Progression
- **Automatic Scaling**: Difficulty adjusts based on player performance patterns
- **Rule Unlocking**: New inference rules unlock with demonstrated proficiency
- **Patience Reduction**: Customer patience gradually decreases over time
- **Complexity Increase**: More premises and longer solution paths over time

### Available Inference Rules and Operations
